# Cellular Subscriptions vs Literacy Rates Scatter Plot
This is a simple `scatterplot graph` built with `D3.JS` and `SVGs`

The data used has been sourced and compiled from various [UN data](https://data.un.org/) points concerning the world's nations

The graph represents the world's nations' `cellular subscriptions` vs `literacy rates`

The scatterplots' `color scale` (`green -> blue`) represents the nations' `urban population rate` (`low -> high`), while their `radius scale` (`3 -> 30`) represents the nations' `median age` (`low -> high`)

`Hovering` over a nation's scatterplot (or `touching` for devices that support touch) displays a tooltip with more detailed information

The app, and online editor, can also be found here on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/d3-cellular-subscriptions-vs-literacy-rates-scatter-plot-using-svg-juovf)

Below is a preview of how it looks like:
